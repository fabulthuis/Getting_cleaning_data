# Course Project "Getting and Cleaning Data"This repository contains the Course Project for the Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data". The assignment was to transform several raw datasets into one tidy data set. The repository contains the following files: ## CodeBook.mdThe codebook describes the source of the raw data and contains links to the website the data is collected from. It describes the transformations that are applied to the data in order to create a tidy data set. Further it contains a description of each variable in the resulting tidy data set. ## run_analysis.RThis R-script was used to download the raw data from the website and perform the necessary transformations to finally write a tidy data set as output. .
